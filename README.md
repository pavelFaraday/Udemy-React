## 10 Side Effects (Effect), Reducers, Context API

**Side Effect**

> A React side-effect occurs when we use something that is **outside the scope of React.js** in our React components e.g. the Browser APIs like localStorage.It means that it is not part of the React framework, for example, the localStorage in your browser.When we use React with any of the Browserâ€™s API such as the localStorage, we are creating side-effects.

-   Store Data in browsers storage
-   Send http requests to backend servers, handling errors after http requests
-   Set & Manage timers, intervals

**useEffect Hook**
The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components.
